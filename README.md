# Friendlier Fire (OpenMW)

Rebelling followers begone!

*For MWSE alternative check out [No More Friendly Fire](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48801) by Celediel.*

## What It Does

- Prevents any followers from aggroing at you. Includes:
  - NPC/creature followers
  - Player's summons
  - Follower's summons
- Stops followers from fighting each other
- Prevents you and your followers from harming each other with spells
- Reduces physical player-to-follower damage and vice versa (configurable)

## Shortcomings

- While the spells are disabled as soon as they are detected, they still manage to inflict a sliver of damage and trigger a red vignette. They might get you killed if you're at 1 HP, but otherwise it's barely noticeable.
- When followers try to aggro on you, they still shout their combat line.
